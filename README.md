`CausalR` is an R-Shiny user-friendly interface for `CausalImpact` R package, which leverages the Bayesian modeling capabilities to estimate the causal effect of an intervention on a time series (Brodersen et al., 2015).  `CausalImpact` is inferred by comparing the counterfactual posterior and the observed data, but users are currently not able to easily navigate to the analysis and visualize the results. Going one step beyond, CausalR is able to generate and visualize a counterfactual prediction, or “what would have happened”, with highly customized features. In addition, `CausalR` introduces a new workflow streamlining the causal analysis by giving users high input data customization, automating model building, and generating informative visualizations. Furthermore, `CausalR` also offers a direct connection to the API of the Pandora data platform, one of the largest archeological databases where various types of time series of data are made available.
